# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

This project covers an exchange economy with two agents.
1) The exchange lense is plotted in an Edgeworth box
2) The market failure for prices p1 = [0.5 , 2.5] in increments of 1/75 is calculated
3) The market clearing price is found using iterations
4) Price p1 is found when A maximizes its own utility and consumes the left over supply in the market
5) Allocation of goods is found when A maximizes its own utility from the set found in question 1.
6) Allocation of goods is found when a utilitarian social planner maximizes aggregate utility
7) 50 endowment bundles are drawn from a uniform distribution
8) The equilibrium price p1 is found from the 50 endowment pairs in question 7. Next, all allocations from these endowments and p1 are plotted in an Edgeworth box.
